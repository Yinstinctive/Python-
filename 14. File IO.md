##### Reading Files
you can read a file with the open function<br>
open returns a file object<br>
you can read a file object with the read method<br>
##### Cursor Movement
Python reads files by using a cursor<br>
This is like the cursor you see when you're typing<br>
After a file is read, the cursor is at the end<br>
To move the cursor, use the seek method<br>
```Python
file.seek(0)
file.readline()
file.readlines()
```
**Closing a File**
you can close a file with the close method<br>
you can check if a file is closed with the closed attribute<br>
once closed, a file can't be read again<br>

**with Blocks**
```Python
# option 1 
file = open("story.txt")
file.read()
file.close()
file.closed #True
```
```Python
# option 2
with open("story.txt") as file:
    file.read()
file.closed #True
```
**with statement实际上在开始和结束时调用了.\_\_enter\_\_()和.\_\_exit\_\_(), 因此只要有.\_\_enter\_\_()和.\_\_exit\_\_()就可以使用with statment**

##### Writing to Text Files
you can also use open to write to a file<br>
need to specify the "w" flag as the second argument<br>
```Python
with open("haiku.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("abcdefg")
#will override everything, not adding to the original one
```
###### Modes for Opening Files
'r' - open for reading(default)<br>
'w' - open for writing, truncating the file first<br>
'x' - open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists<br>
'a' - open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists<br>
'r+' - read and write to a file (writing based on cursor), will override based on the cursor position, only works with existing file<br>
'b' - binary mode<br>
't' - text mode<br>
'+' - open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)<br>
'wb' - writing binary<br>
'rb' - reading binary<br>

###### Reading CSV Files
CSV files are a common file format for tabular data<br>
we can read CSV files just like other text files<br>
Python has a bulit-in CSV module to read/write CSVs more easily<br>

##### CSV Module
reader - lets you iterate over rows of the CSV as lists<br>
DictReader - lets you iterate over rows of the CSV as OrderedDicts<br>

```Python
# Using reader
from csv import reader
with open("fighters.csv") as file:
    csv_reader = reader(file)
    next(csv_reader) #To skip the headers
    for fighter in csv_reader:
        # Each row is a list
        # Use index to access data
        print(f"{fighter[0]} is from {fighter[1]}")
```
```Python
# Example where data is cast into a list
from csv import reader
with open("fighters.csv") as file:
    csv_reader = reader(file)
    data = list(csv_reader)
    print(data)
```
```Python
# Reading/Parsing CSV Using a DictReader:
from csv import DictReader
with open("fighters.csv") as file:
    csv_reader = DictReader(file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        # Each row is an OrderedDict!
        print(row['Name']) #Use keys to access data
```
##### Other Delimiters
Readers accept a delimiter kwarg in case your data isn't separated by <br>
```Python
from csv import reader
with open("example.csv") as file:
    csv_reader = reader(file, delimiter="|")
    for row in csv_reader
        print(row)
```
##### Writing CSV Files - using lists
writer - creates a writer object for writing to CSV<br>
writerow - method on a writer to wrtie a row to the CSV<br>
```Python
from csv import writer
with open("fighters.csv", "w") as file:
    csv_writer = writer(file)
    csv_writer.writerow(["Character", "Move"])
```
```Python
from csv import writer, DictWriter
# Version using writer
with open("cats.csv", "w") as file:
    csv_writer = writer(file)
    csv_writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])
     csv_writer.writerow(["Blue", 3])
    csv_writer.writerow(["Kitty", 1])
```
```Python
from csv import reader, writer
# using nested with statements 注意：读写同一个文件时不能用嵌套的open
with open('fighters.csv') as file:
    csv_reader = reader(file) #data never converted to list
    with open('screaming_fighters.csv', "w") as file:
        csv_writer = writer(file)
        for fighter in csv_reader:
            csv_writer.writerow([s.upper() for s in fighter])
```
```Python
# Other approach, with only 1 file open at a time
with open('fighters.csv') as file:
    csv_reader = reader(file)
    # data converted to list and saved to variable
    fighters = [[s.upper() for s in row] for row in csv_reader]

with open('screaming_fighters.csv', "w") as file:
    csv_writer = writer(file)
    for fighter in fighters:
        csv_writer.writerow(fighter)
```
##### Writing CSV Files - using dictionaries
DictWriter - creates a writer object for writing using dictionaries<br>
fieldnames - kwarg for the DictWriter specifying headers<br>
writeheader - method on a writer to write header row<br>
writerow - method on a writer to write a row based on a dictionary<br>
```Python
# Version using DictWriter
with open("cats.csv", "w") as file:
    headers = ["Name", "Breed", "Age"]
    csv_writer = DictWriter(file, fieldnames=headers)
    csv_writer.writeheader()
    csv_writer.writerow({
        "Name": "Garfield",
        "Breed": "Orange Tabby",
        "Age": 10
    })
```
```Python
from csv import DictReader, DictWriter

def cm_to_in(cm):
    return float(cm) * 0.393701

with open("fighters.csv") as file:
    csv_reader = DictReader(file)
    fighters = list(csv_reader)

with open("inches_fighters.csv", "w") as file:
    headers = ("Name","Country","Height")
    csv_writer = DictWriter(file, fieldnames=headers)
    csv_writer.writeheader()
    for f in fighters:
        csv_writer.writerow({
            "Name": f["Name"],
            "Country": f["Country"],
            "Height": cm_to_in(f["Height (in cm)"])
        })
```
```Python
enumerate()
list1 = ["这", "是", "一个", "测试"] 
for index, item in enumerate(list1): 
    print index, item 
>>> 
0 这 
1 是 
2 一个 
3 测试
```
##### Pickle/pickling: Python object serialization
```Python
import pickle
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is a {self.species}"

    def make_sound(self, sound):
        print(f"this animal says {sound}")
```
```Python
class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed, toy):
        super().__init__(name, species="Cat") # Call init on parent class
        self.breed = breed
        self.toy = toy

    def play(self):
        print(f"{self.name} plays with {self.toy}")


blue = Cat("Blue", "Scottish Fold", "String")
```
```Python
# To pickle an object:
with open("pets.pickle", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(blue, file)
```
```Python
# To unpickle something:
with open("pets.pickle", "rb") as file:
    zombie_blue = pickle.load(file)
    print(zombie_blue)
    print(zombie_blue.play())
```
