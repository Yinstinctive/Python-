**google.com**
	1. DNS Lookup
	2. Computer makes a request to a server
	3. Server processes  the request
	4. Server issues a response
	5. Request/response cycle (2-4)

**HTTP Headers**<br>
sent with both requests and responses<br>
provide additional information about the request or response
**Header Examples**
1. Request Headers
- Accept - Acceptable content-types for response (e.g. htm, json, xml)
- Cache-Control - Specify caching behavior
- User-Agent - Information about the software used to make the request
2. Response Headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin - specify domains that can make requests
- Allowed - HTTP verbs that are allowed in requests

**Response Status Codes**
- 2xx - Success
- 3xx - Redirect
- 4xx - Client Error
- 5xx - Server ErrorHTTP 

**Verbs and APIs**
1. GET
- useful for retrieving data
- data passed in query string
- should have no "side-effect"
- can be cached
- can be bookmarked

2. POST
- useful for writing data
- data passed in body
- can have "side-effects"
- not cached
- can't be bookmarked

**APIs**
- API - Application Programming Interface
- Allows you to get data from another application without needing to understand how the application works
- Can often send data back in different formats
- Examples of companies with APIs: GitHub, Spotify, Google

**Using the requests Module**
```Python
import requests
res = requests.get("#URL")
res.ok
res.headers
res.text
res.status_code
```
**requests Module**
- lets us make HTTP request from our Python code
- installed using pip
- useful for web scraping/crawling, grabbing data from other APIs, etc

**Request Headers**
```Python
import requests
response = requests.get(
    "http://www.example.com",
    headers = {
        "header1": "value1",
        "header2": "value2"
    }
)

headers = {"Accept": "application/json"}
headers = {"Accept": "text/plain"}

print(response.text) #string
print(response.json()) #dictionary
```
**What's a Query String**
- a way to pass data to the server as part of a GET request
- http://www.example.com/?key1=value1&key2=value2
```Python
import requests
response = requests.get(
   "http://www.example.com/?key1=value1&key2=value2"
)

import requests
response = requests.get(
    "http://www.example.com",
    params = {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    }
)
```
**API Project**
```Python
import requests
import pyfiglet
import termcolor
from random import choice

header = pyfiglet.figlet_format("Dad Joke 3000")
header = termcolor.colored(header, color="magenta")
print(header)

term = input("Let me tell you a joke! Give me a topic: ")
response_json = requests.get(
    "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search",
    headers={"Accept": "application/json"},
    params={"term": term}
).json()
results = response_json["results"]
total_jokes = response_json["total_jokes"]
if total_jokes > 1:
    print(
        f"I've got {total_jokes} jokes about {term}. Here's one:\n",
        choice(results)['joke']
    )
elif total_jokes == 1:
    print(
        f"I've got one joke about {term}. Here it is:\n",
        results[0]['joke']
    )
else:
    print(f"Sorry, I don't have any jokes about {term}! Please try again.")
```
