**What is OOP?**<br>
Object oriented programming is a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a class or object.<br>

class - a blueprint for objects. Classes can contain methods(functions) and attributes(similar to keys in a dict).<br>

instance - objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contain their class's methods and properties.<br>

**Why OOP?**<br>
With object oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate your code into logical, hierarchical groupings using classes so that you can reason about your code at a higher level.

**Encapsulation**<br>
the grouping of public and private attributes and methods into a programmatic class, making abstraction possible

**Abstraction**<br>
exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, hiding private attributes and methods from users

**Creating Classes and Instances**<br>
classes in Python can have a special __init__method, which gets called every time you create an instance of the class(instantiate)
```Python
class User:
    pass
```
```Python
class User:
    def __init__(self, first, last, age):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.age = age
#定义类方法的时候需要有self参数，没有的话会报错
```
```Python
#_name #suppose to be a private varible
#__name #save in _ClassName__AttributeName, name mangling, 继承的时候用来区别子类和父类的相同属性名称
#__name__ #used for Python specific methods like __init__, __len__, etc

class User:
    def __init__(self, first, last, age):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.age = age

    def full_name(self):
        return f"{self.first} {self.last}"

    def initials(self):
        return f"{self.first[0]}.{self.last[0]}."

    def likes(self, thing):
        return f"{self.first} likes {thing}"

    def is_senior(self):
        return self.age >= 65

    def birthday(self):
        self.age += 1
        return f"Happy {self.age}th, {self.first}"
```
**Class Attributes**<br>
We can also define attributes directly on a class that are shared by all instances of a class and the class itself
```Python
class User:

    active_users = 0

    def __init__(self, first, last, age):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.age = age
        User.active_users +=1    
```
```Python
class Pet:
    allowed = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'rat']

    def __init__(self, name, species):
        if species not in Pet.allowed:
            raise ValueError(f"You can't have a {species} pet!")
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def set_species(self,species):
        if species not in Pet.allowed:
            raise ValueError(f"You can't have a {species} pet!")
        self.species = species
```
**Class Methods**<br>
class methods are methods (with the @classmethod decorator) that are not concerned with instances, but class itself.
```Python
class User:
    active_users = 0

    @classmethod
    def display_active_users(cls):
        return f"There are currently {cls.active_users} active users"
    
    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, data_str):
        first, last, age = data_str.split(",")
        return cls(firs, last, int(age))
    
print(User.discplay_active_users())
```

**String Representation Example**<br>
the __repr__ method is one of several ways to provide a nicer string representation
```Python
def __repr__(self):
    return f"{self.first} is {self.age}"

tom= User("Tom", "Cat", 18)
print(tom) #tom is 18 
```
**Inheritance**<br>
a key feature of OOP is the ability to define a class which inherits from another class (a "base" or "parent" class)
in Python, inheritance works by passing the parent class as an argument to the definition of a child class
```Python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self, sound):
        print(sound)
    cool = True

class Cat(Animal):
    pass

gandalf = Cat()
gandalf. make_sound("meow") #meow
gandalf.cool #True
```
**Properties**<br>
@property<br>
@property_name.setter<br>

super()<br>
```Python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.name} is a {self.species}"

    def make_sound(self, sound):
        print(f"this animal says {sound}")

class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed, toy):
        super().__init__(name, species="Cat") # Call init on parent class
        self.breed = breed
        self.toy = toy

    def play(self):
        print(f"{self.name} plays with {self.toy}")

blue = Cat("Blue","Scottish Fold", "String")
blue.play()
```
**Multiple Inheritance**<br>
Python also allows classes to inherit from more than one parent class

**Multiple Resolution Order(MRO)**
whenever you create a class, Python sets a Method Resolution Order for that class, which is the order in which Python will look for methods on instances of that class.

you can programmactically reference the MRO in three ways:
- \_\_mro\_\_ attribute on the class
- use the mro() method on the class
- use the built-in help(cls) method

**Polymorphism**<br>
a key principle in OOP is the idea of polymorphism - an object can take on many forms<br>
two important practical applications:
1. the same class method works in a similar way of different classes<br>
    a common implementation of this is to have method in a base class that is overridden by a sub class. This is called method overriding.
    ```Python
    Cat.speak()
    Dog.speak(0
    Human.speak()
2. the same operation works for different kinds of objects
    ```Python
    len(list/tuple/string)
    ```
**Special Methods Example**<br>
```Python
8+2 #10
"8"+"2" #"82"
```
the + operator is shorthand for a special method called __add__() that gets called on the first operand<br>
if the first(left) operand is an istance of int, __add__() does mathematical addition. If it's a string, it does string concatenation<br>

\_\_len\_\_()
\_\_repr\_\_()
