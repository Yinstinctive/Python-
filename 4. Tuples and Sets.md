### Tuple: An ordered collection or grouping of items
```Python
numbers = (1,2,3,4)
```
It is immutable. Can never be changed.
```Python
locations = {
    (35.6895, 39.6917): "Tokyo Office",
    (40.7128, 74.0060): "New York Office"
}
// cannot use list as dictionary key
```
**Why use a Tuple?**
1. Tuples are faster than lists
2. It makes your code safer
3. Valid keys in a dictionary
4. Some methods return them to you - like .items() when working with dictionaries

**Creating/Accessing Tuple**
```Python
first_tuple = (1,2,3,3,3)
first_tuple[1] //2
first_tuple[-1] //3
value = (1,) #need comma , 
```
**tuple() constructor**
```Python
thistuple = tuple(("apple","banana","cherry"))
```
We can use a for loop to iterate over a tuple just like a list
```Python
numbers = (1,2,3,4)
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```
**Tuple methods**
count: returns the number of times a value appears in a tuple
```Python
x = (1,2,3,3,3)
x.count(3) #3
```
**index: returns the index at which a value is found in a tuple**
```Python
x.index(1) #0
x.index(3) #2 - only the first matching index is returned
```
### Sets:
1. sets are like formal mathematical sets
2. sets do not have duplicate values
3. elements in sets are not ordered
4. you cannot access items in a set by index
5. sets can be useful if you need to keep track of a collection of elements, but don't care about ordering, keys or values and duplicates

**Creating/Accessing**
```Python
s = set({1,4,5})
s = {1,4,5}
4 in s #True
```
**remove duplicates**
```Python
cities = ['a', 'b','b','c',''d]
list(set(cities))
```
**add: adds an element to a set. if the element is already in the set, the set doesn't change**
```Python
s = set([1,2,3])
s.add(4) #{1,2,3,4}
```
**remove: removes a value from the set - returns a KeyError if the value is not found**
```Python
s.remove(2)
#could use .discard if do not want error
s.discard(5)
```
**copy: creates a copy of the set**
```Python
another_s = s.copy()
```
**clear: removes all the contents of the set**
```Python
s.clear()
```
**Set Math**
```Python
math_students = {"Matthew", "Helen", "Prashant", "James", "Aparna"}
biology_students = {"Jane", "Matthew", "Charlotte", "Mesut", "Oliver", "James"}
math_students | biology_students # union |
math_students & biology_students # intersection &
```
**Set Comprehension**
```Python
{x**2 for x in range(10)} #{0,1,64,4,36,9,16,49,81,25}
{char.upper() for char in 'hello'} # {'O','L', 'H', 'E'}
```
```Python
string = "hello"
{char for char in string if char in 'aeiou'} #{'e', 'o'}
```
