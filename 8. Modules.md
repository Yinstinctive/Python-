**Why Use Modules?**
- keep Python files small
- reuse code across multiple files by importing
- a module is just a Python file

**Built-in Modules Example**
```Python
import random
random.choice(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])
random.shuffle(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])
```
**Importing Parts of a Module**
- the from keyword lets you import parts of a module
- handy rule of thumb: only import what you need
- if you still want to import everything, you can also use the from MODULE import * pattern

```Python
from random import choice, randint
```
**Different Ways to Import**
```Python
import random
import random as omg_so_random
from random import *
from random import choice, shuffle
from random import choice as give_me_one, shuffle as mixed_up_fruits
```
**Custom Modules**
```Python
#file1.py
de fn():
    return "do some stuff"
def other_fn:
    return "do some other stuff"

#file2.py
import file1
file1.fn()
file1.other_fn()
```
**External Modules**
- using package management system for Python, pip
- python3 -m pip install NAME_OF_PACKAGE

dir # return a list of valid attributes for that object
help # generate a help page for the object

Using the autopep8 package to clean up code

**__name__variable**
- when run, every Python file has a __name__variable
- if the file the main file being run, its value is "__main__"
- otherwise, its value is the file name

**note: when using import, Python...**
	1. Tries to find the module (if it fails, it throws an error)
	2. runs the code inside of the module being imported
**Ignoring Code on Import**
```Python
if __name__=="__main__":
    # this code will only run if the file is the main file
```
