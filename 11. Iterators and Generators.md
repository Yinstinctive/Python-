**Iterators and Iterables**<br>
Iterator - an object that can be iterated upon. An object which returns data. one element at a time when next(0 is called on it<br>
Iterable - an object which will return an Iterator when iter() is called on it<br>
iter(iterable) --> interator<br>
next(iterator) --> data<br>

**Next**<br>
when next() is called on an iterator, the iterator returns the next item. It keeps doing so until it raises a StopIteration error<br>
```Python
#Custom For Loop
def my_for(iterable, func):
    iterator = iter(iterable)
    while True:
        try:
            thing = next(iterator)
        except StopIteration:
            break
        else:
            func(thing)
        
def square(x):
    print(x*x)

my_for("lol", print)
my_for([1,2,3,4,5], square)
```
```Python
#Custom Iterator
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, low, high):
        self.current = low
        self.high = high

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current < self.high:
            num = self.current
            self.current += 1
            return num
        raise StopIteration

for x in Counter(50,70):
    print(x)
```

**Generator**<br>
generators are iterators<br>
generators can be created with generator functions<br>
generator functions use the yield keyword<br>
generators can be created with generator expressions<br>
```Python
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count # return the count(generator object) and pause until next() is called
        count +=1
```
**Generator Expression**<br>
sum(n for n in range(1000))
