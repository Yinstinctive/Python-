**MAC/LINUX Commend Line:**
pwd # print working directory
cd # change directory
>”.” stands for current directory
>“..” stands for parent directory. This allows for relative navigation

ls # list the contents of a directory. You can supply options such as “-a” to list all files (including hidden ones), or “-l” for a longer format
mkdir #make directory
touch # the command “touch” followed by the filename and file-type extension will create a new file of that type
mv # files can be moved or renamed using the “mv” keyword, which takes two arguments: the source and the destination
`mv favs.text GOAT.txt #rename`
`mv GOAT.txt ../ #move to parent directory`
rm #remove Directories can also be deleted using “rm” keyword, with the added option “-r”(recursive). You can also use “-f” (force) to prevent warnings

**Formatting Strings**
F - Strings (new in Python 3.6):
```Python
x=10
formatted = f”I’ve told you {x} times already!”
```
.format method (Python 2-3.5)
```Python
x=10
formatted = “I’ve told you {} times already”.format(x)
```
**Converting Data Types:**
```Python
decimal = 12.34234
integer = int (decimal) #12
```
**Getting User Input:**
```Python
name = input (“Enter your name here:”)
```

**Conditional Statements:**
```Python
if <condition>:
    do something
elif <condition>:
    do something
else:
    do something
```

**Truthiness:**
```Python
    x=1
    x is 1 # True
    x is 0 # False
```
empty objects, empty strings, None and zero —> naturally falsy
```Python
animal = input("enter your favorite animal")    
if animal:
    print(animal + " is my favorite too!")
else:
    print("YOU DIDNT SAY ANYTHING!")
```
Difference between is and “==“
```Python
a = 1
a == 1 # True
a is 1 # True
a = [1,2,3]
b = [1,2,3]
a == b # True
a is b # False
```
**for loops**
```Python
for item in iterable_object:
    # do something with item
```
**range**
```Python
range(7) # 0-6
range(1,8) # 1-7
range(1,10,2) # 1,3,5,7,9
range(7,0,-1) #integer from 7 to 1
```

**while loops**
```Python
while <condition>
    # do something
```
